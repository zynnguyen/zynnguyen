👋 Hey there, I'm @zynnguyen, your friendly neighborhood web and mobile app enthusiast!
👀 I'm all about crafting awesome websites and mobile apps that make life easier and more fun.
🌱 Currently, I'm diving into the world of Java to whip up some cool Android apps, tinkering with Django for web app wizardry, and always exploring the latest in Front End tech. Oh, and I'm also mastering the art of Webflow!
💞️ Looking to team up on projects that involve creating stunning websites or innovative mobile apps.
📫 Reach out to me at zyniiee@gmail.com, and let's make some digital magic happen!
⚡ Fun fact: I have a slight obsession with bubble tea. Seriously, it's like my fuel for creativity! 🧋✨
